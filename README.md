# Circadian Phosphopeptide NN Analyser
Analytic neural network for the identification of early &amp; late circadian phosphopeptide classes

* Input is phosphoproteomic abundances (phospho state) and circadian phases (48 Hr: 8 points)
* Various tissue types; Mouse (young:BLK, aged:BLK, treated:BLK) & Human cell-line
* Replicas 2X individuals
* Separate validation data; distinct tissue types
* Train baseline classifier
* Distil artitecture for limited marker selection
